Description:  Ahcpd is a daemon for configuring an IPv6 network using the Ad-Hoc
 Configuration Protocol (AHCP).  AHCP is designed for wireless mesh
 networks, where IPv6 autoconfiguration and DHCPv6 do not work, but may
 also be used on wired networks.

Description:  alfred is a user space daemon for distributing arbitrary local information
 over the mesh/network in a decentralized fashion. This data can be anything
 which appears to be useful - originally designed to replace the batman-adv
 visualization (vis), you may distribute hostnames, phone books, administration
 information, DNS information, the local weather forecast ...
 
 alfred runs as daemon in the background of the system. A user may insert
 information by using the alfred binary on the command line, or use special
 programs to communicate with alfred (done via unix sockets). alfred then takes
 care of distributing the local information to other alfred servers on other
 nodes. This is done via IPv6 link-local multicast, and does not require any
 configuration. A user can request data from alfred, and will receive the
 information available from all alfred servers in the network.

 using DHCP to configure their routers rather than speaking to their
 upstream provider with a proper routing protocol.

Description:  Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol for IPv6 and IPv4
 with fast convergence properties. It is based on the ideas in DSDV, AODV and
 Cisco's EIGRP, but is designed to work well not only in wired networks but
 also in wireless mesh networks, and has been extended with support for
 overlay networks. Babel is an IETF standard protocol (RFC 8966).

Description:  BIRD is an internet routing daemon which manages TCP/IP routing tables
 with support of modern routing protocols, easy to use configuration
 interface and powerful route filtering language. It is lightweight and
 efficient and therefore appropriate for small embedded routers.
 
 This packages the legacy v1.6 branch of Bird, which splits IPv4 and IPv6
 support into separate binaries. See also the bird2 package for the newer
 branch which integrates support for both IP protocols in a single binary.
 
 This is IPv4 version of BIRD, it supports OSPFv2, RIPv2 and BGP
 protocols.
 
 In BGP, BIRD supports communities, multiprotocol extensions, MD5
 authentication, 32bit AS numbers and could act as a route server or a
 route reflector. BIRD also supports multiple RIBs, multiple kernel
 routing tables and redistribution between the protocols with a powerful
 configuration syntax.

Description:  Mesh11sd is a dynamic parameter configuration daemon for 802.11s mesh networks.
 It was originally designed to leverage 802.11s mesh networking at Captive Portal venues.
 This is the open source version and it enables easy and automated mesh network operation with multiple mesh nodes.
 It allows all mesh parameters supported by the wireless driver to be set in the uci config file.
 Settings take effect immediately without having to restart the wireless network.
 Default settings give rapid and reliable layer 2 mesh convergence.
 Without mesh11sd, many mesh parameters cannot be set in the uci wireless config file as the mesh interface must be up before the parameters can be set.
 Some of those that are supported, would fail to be implemented when the network is (re)started resulting in errors or dropped nodes.
 The mesh11sd daemon dynamically checks configured parameters and sets them as required.
 This version does not require a Captive Portal to be running.

Description:  This package contains a daemon which can be used to forward
 PCP (Port Control Protocol - RFC6887) requests requests to PCP remote servers.
 
 In and of itself, it is not very useful, but combined with hnetd+miniupnpd
 it allows for control of NAT forwarding and firewall pinholes from multiple
 hops away.

Description:  Reboots or triggers watchdog if no link-local neighbor is available.
 
 Important:
 Be careful when you do a sysupgrade. Stop naywatch first, and make
 sure procd took control again of the watchdog.
 You can do this using 'ubus call system watchdog'.  Status should be "running".

Description:  ndppd, or NDP Proxy Daemon, is a daemon that proxies NDP (Neighbor Discovery
 Protocol) messages between interfaces.  ndppd currently only supports Neighbor
 Solicitation Messages and Neighbor Advertisement Messages.
 
 The ndp_proxy provided by Linux doesn't support listing proxies, and only hosts
 are supported.  No subnets.  ndppd solves this by listening for Neighbor
 Solicitation messages on an interface, then query the internal interfaces for
 that target IP before finally sending a Neighbor Advertisement message.

Description:  openNDS (open Network Demarcation Service) is a high performance, small footprint, Captive Portal.
 It provides a border control gateway between a public local area network and the Internet.
 It supports all scenarios ranging from small stand alone venues through to large mesh networks with multiple portal entry points.
 Both the client driven Captive Portal Detection method (CPD) and gateway driven Captive Portal Identification method (CPI - RFC 8910 and RFC 8908) are supported.
 This version requires iptables-nft.

Description:  Prince is an open source implementation of the PopRouting Algorithm.
 It has been developed as a Google Summer of Code Project in collaboration with Freifunk and the University of Trento.
 
 Prince fetches topology data from a Link State routing daemon (OONF, OLSR, OSPF, etc),
 calculates the betweenness centrality using the topology and then computes the
 the timers' optimal values using these data. At the end of the computation the timers are pushed back to the routing daemon.
 Since v0.4 it supports both OONF and OLSRd.
